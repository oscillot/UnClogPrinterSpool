UnclogPrinterSpool.exe v1.0

First binary executable version with a GUI. Functions essentially the same as before.

Executable can be found at \UnClogPrinterSpool\bin\Debug\UnClogPrinterSpool.exe

UnClogPrinterSpool.bat beta

This is a simple batch file that asks for your permission to clear out the folders that house printer spool files. This is useful when a document randomly fails to print, a large job fails to cancel or a file is for some other reason stuck in the spool. It erases the spool for all printers non-discriminantly, there are no plans for this to change in the future. A gui version will come next.
